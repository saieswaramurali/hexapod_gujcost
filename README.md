![hexapod_rendered](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9dc10749-d024-4cbf-97d7-f600535d30f0)

This repository contains the ROS 2 codebase for a hexapod robot developed under the GUJCOST-funded project. It includes joystick-based control, SLAM integration, step detection, and modular movement control.

## üêú Project Overview

The hexapod robot is designed to perform walking, sitting, and standing motions using servo motors. Control is handled via joystick input, and servo angles are published through ROS 2 topics. The robot is being extended to include autonomous navigation using SLAM and stair/step detection.
